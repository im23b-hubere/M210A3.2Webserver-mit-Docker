# Docker Container Guide

## What is Docker?

Docker is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in isolated environments called containers. Containers package an application with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Container
- A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application
- Isolated from other containers and the host system
- More efficient than virtual machines as they share the host OS kernel

### 2. Image
- A read-only template used to create containers
- Contains the application code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies
- Can be built from a Dockerfile or pulled from a registry like Docker Hub

### 3. Dockerfile
- A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image
- Defines the base image, dependencies, and configuration
- Each instruction creates a new layer in the image

### 4. Docker Hub
- A cloud-based registry service for sharing and managing Docker images
- Contains official images for popular software like Nginx, MySQL, etc.
- Allows you to pull pre-built images or push your own

## Benefits of Using Docker

1. **Consistency**: Applications run the same way in development, testing, and production
2. **Isolation**: Applications are isolated from each other and the host system
3. **Portability**: Containers can run on any system that has Docker installed
4. **Scalability**: Easy to scale applications by running multiple containers
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel, using fewer resources than VMs

## Common Docker Commands

```bash
docker pull nginx

docker ps

docker ps -a

docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx

docker stop <container_id>

docker rm <container_id>

docker build -t my-image .

docker push username/my-image
```

## Best Practices

1. Use official base images when possible
2. Keep images small by removing unnecessary files
3. Use multi-stage builds for complex applications
4. Don't run containers as root
5. Use environment variables for configuration
6. Implement proper logging
7. Use Docker Compose for multi-container applications

## Security Considerations

1. Keep Docker and images updated
2. Use minimal base images
3. Implement proper access controls
4. Scan images for vulnerabilities
5. Use secrets management for sensitive data
6. Implement network segmentation
7. Monitor container activity

## Common Use Cases

1. Web applications
2. Microservices
3. Development environments
4. CI/CD pipelines
5. Database systems
6. Testing environments
7. Load balancing
